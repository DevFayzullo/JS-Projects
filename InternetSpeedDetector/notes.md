# 📓 Fast Speed Test - Notes

## 🎯 Purpose
- Create a Fast.com-style website to measure **actual internet speed**.
- Use `image download` technique to measure **real Mbps**.
- Minimal UI: large number, status text, and a button.

---

## ✅ What I Learned
- How to use `Image()` to download a file and measure load time.
- Understanding the concept of `performance testing` in JavaScript.
- Using `toFixed(2)` to format numbers in Mbps.
- Working with `DOMContentLoaded` and `onload` events.
- Designing a clean, minimalist HTML/CSS layout.

---

## 🔧 Improvement Ideas
- Add `upload speed` test (advanced)
- Display `ping` or `latency`
- Add loading animation (e.g., spinner)
- Show IP address, browser, and device info

## ✍️ Reflection
Through this project, I understood how **real-world tools** like Fast.com work. I learned how to measure internet speed by downloading a simple image.
