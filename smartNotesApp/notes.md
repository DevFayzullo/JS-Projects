# 📓 Development Notes – Smart Notes App

## 🏁 How It Started

This project started as a simple idea to build a daily notes app while practicing JavaScript. The goal was to make something useful, lightweight, and accessible — where users can write quick thoughts, save them instantly, and not worry about logins or internet. It was also a great opportunity to practice DOM manipulation, `localStorage`, and responsive design.

## 🎯 Key Goals

* Practice real-world JavaScript features (`add`, `edit`, `delete` with `localStorage`)
* Build a responsive and modern UI
* Add search, timestamps, and theme toggle
* Keep everything local and offline-ready

## ⚙️ Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Editing Notes Without Replacing the Original**

**Issue:** At first, editing a note would overwrite the wrong one or not save at all.
**Fix:** Indexed each note and confirmed edit via `prompt()`, then updated `notes[index]` before saving.

### 2. **Dark Mode Persistence**

**Issue:** Theme reset on refresh.
**Fix:** Stored theme in `localStorage` and applied it on page load with a `darkMode` flag.

### 3. **Mobile UI Breakage**

**Issue:** On small screens, buttons overlapped or text area overflowed.
**Fix:** Used media queries to adjust padding, font sizes, and layout spacing.

### 4. **Notes Getting Lost**

**Issue:** Notes would disappear if the page refreshed too early.
**Fix:** Wrapped all updates with `localStorage.setItem()` immediately after changes.

### 5. **Search Filtering Not Instant**

**Issue:** Search bar didn’t update results live.
**Fix:** Connected `input` event to `renderNotes()` with a filter argument.

This app started as a side experiment but ended up being one of the most complete and polished mini-projects in my portfolio. Simple in idea — but rich in learning. 🚀
