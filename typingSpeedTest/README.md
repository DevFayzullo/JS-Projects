## 🧪 How It Works

1. The user starts typing the displayed text.
2. The timer starts automatically on the first keystroke.
3. Each character typed is compared to the target and color-coded.
4. On timeout, the app calculates:

   * Total typed words
   * Correct character percentage (accuracy)
   * Final WPM
   * Grade (A–F) based on accuracy
