# 🛠️ JavaScript Projects Collection

[🇰🇷 한국어 README](./README.ko.md)

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects Repository!
This repository is a growing collection of mini JavaScript projects that I build daily to improve my skills, experiment with new ideas, and learn frontend development.

---

## 📌 About

Each folder in this repository contains a separate project built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS, sometimes with APIs)

Projects are small, focused, and designed to be completed in a few hours or less.
The goal is to practice consistently and build a strong portfolio.

## 🗓️ Daily Contribution Plan

I aim to:

- ✅ Add one project per day
- ✅ Learn a new concept or technique with each project
- ✅ Maintain clean and organized code
