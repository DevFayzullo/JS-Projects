# 🛠️ JavaScript Projects Collection

Welcome to my **JavaScript Projects Repository**!  
This repository is a growing collection of **mini JavaScript projects** that I build daily to improve my skills, experiment with new ideas, and learn frontend development.

---

## 📌 About

Each folder in this repository contains a **separate project** built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS, sometimes with APIs)

Projects are small, focused, and designed to be completed in a few hours or less.  
The goal is to practice consistently and build a strong portfolio.

## 📅 Daily Contribution Plan

I aim to:
- ✅ Add **one project per day**
- ✅ Learn a new concept or technique with each project
- ✅ Maintain clean and organized code
